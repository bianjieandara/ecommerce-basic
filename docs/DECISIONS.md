# Decisions log

Short ADR-style entries: date, decision, reason. Add an entry whenever a dependency is added,
an external API behaves differently from the plan, or a plan item is changed.

## 2026-10-21 — Stage 0

- **Astro 7 (latest stable)** instead of the Astro 5 pattern in older docs. Reason: plan says "latest stable".
- **Cloudflare adapter with `imageService: "passthrough"`**. Reason: we resize images in the browser, so no paid transforms.
- **Tailwind v4 through `@tailwindcss/vite`**. Reason: plan styling decision; no PostCSS config needed.
- **`@client` alias falls back to `clients/_default/extensions`** when the active client has no folder.
- **Layer boundary rule also blocks `ui`, `pages` and `clients` from importing `composition`**. Reason: the plan says UI never
  imports composition (section 2.1). The lint rule enforces it.
- **Pre-scripts (`predev`, `prebuild`) that call `scripts/use-client.mjs` are added in Stage 1**, when the script exists.
  Reason: avoid a failing build before the script is written.
- **Stage 0 root route is a plain `ok` endpoint** (`src/pages/index.ts`). Replaced in Stage 7.
