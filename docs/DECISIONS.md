# Decisions log

Short ADR-style entries: date, decision, reason. Add an entry whenever a dependency is added,
an external API behaves differently from the plan, or a plan item is changed.

## 2026-10-21 — Stage 0

- **Astro 7 (latest stable)** instead of the Astro 5 pattern in older docs. Reason: plan says "latest stable".
- **Cloudflare adapter with `imageService: "passthrough"`**. Reason: we resize images in the browser, so no paid transforms.
- **Tailwind v4 through `@tailwindcss/vite`**. Reason: plan styling decision; no PostCSS config needed.
- **`@client` alias falls back to `clients/_default/extensions`** when the active client has no folder.
- **Layer boundary rule also blocks `ui`, `pages` and `clients` from importing `composition`**. Reason: the plan says UI never
  imports composition (section 2.1). The lint rule enforces it.
- **Pre-scripts (`predev`, `prebuild`) that call `scripts/use-client.mjs`** were added in Stage 1, once the script existed.
- **Stage 0 root route is a plain `ok` endpoint** (`src/pages/index.ts`). Replaced in Stage 7.
- **`@types/node` added as a dev dependency**. Reason: `astro.config.mjs` uses `node:fs` and `process.env`; without the types
  `astro check` fails. Type definitions only, no runtime code.

## 2026-10-21 — Stage 1

- **Custom Worker entrypoint is `src/worker.ts`**. It wraps `handle` from `@astrojs/cloudflare/handler` (adapter 14) and adds
  `queue` and `scheduled`. Reason: the adapter builds its own entry, and the default one has no queue or cron handlers.
  Importing `dist/` from `src/` was rejected: it breaks the type check and the build before the first `astro build`.
- **Compatibility date `2026-10-19`** instead of today's date. Reason: the local workerd binary supports up to 2026-10-19;
  a newer date stops `astro dev`.
- **`wrangler.base.jsonc` keeps placeholders**; `scripts/use-client.mjs` writes the root `wrangler.jsonc` (gitignored) for the active client.
- **Dev uses remote bindings** (Browser Run and Analytics SQL). `astro dev` connects to Cloudflare at startup; this is expected.
- **R2 bucket is pending.** The account does not have R2 enabled yet (Cloudflare error 10042). Enable R2 in the dashboard, then run
  `npx wrangler r2 bucket create demo-media`. `scripts/new-client.mjs` creates R2 last and prints this instruction if it fails.
- **Resource creation is idempotent.** D1 and KV are found by name before creating; queues treat "is already taken" as success.
- **`.dev.vars` is copied from `.dev.vars.example`** for local runs; it is gitignored.
- **`wrangler.base.jsonc` and `clients/*/client.jsonc` use trailing commas**, which Wrangler accepts.

## 2026-10-21 — Stage 2

- **Money, tax and totals are integer maths in the domain layer.** `computeLineTax` rounds half up with integers; `computeOrderTotals`
  is the one function used by quotes, checkout, gateways and invoices.
- **Catalog options are passed in, not read from settings.** `parseCatalogQuery` and `catalogQueryToSearchParams` take the currency
  exponent and default sort. The domain never reads settings, so the same function runs in pages, the count API and tests.
- **Dictionaries are typed against `en`.** `es.ts` uses `Dictionary = typeof en`, so a missing Spanish key fails `npm run check`.
- **Missing translation keys render as the key** (visible gap, no crash).
- **Intl formatting lives in `domain/shared/format.ts`** and the UI re-exports it. Verified: a USD price in `es-CO` renders as `US$ 12,50`.
- **Pages must send a charset.** The dev server sends `text/html` without `charset`. The Stage 6 base layout adds
  `<meta charset="utf-8">` and the server keeps UTF-8 output.

## 2026-10-21 — Stage 3

- **Schema is the plan's final version** (`0001_initial.sql`): `notification_log` replaces the earlier `email_log`, and
  `whatsapp_templates`, `failed_jobs` and `daily_metrics` are included from the start.
- **Seed is idempotent only on a fresh database.** Re-running `db:seed:local` inserts duplicates. Reset with
  `Remove-Item -Recurse .wrangler/state`, then migrate and seed again.
- **Verified counts:** 12 products, 20 variants (10 apparel, 10 simple), 24 translations, 24 search rows, 16 "initial" ledger rows
  (the 4 variants with zero stock produce none). FTS prefix search `camiseta*` returns the product.

## 2026-10-21 — Stage 4

- **Ports are written for the stages that use them.** Written now: platform, jobs, payments, catalog, inventory, ordering, invoicing,
  notifications, content, identity, media. Deferred: `whatsapp` (Stage 18), `marketing`, `analytics` (Stage 19), `reports` (Stage 20),
  and the admin list query types (Stages 14 to 16). The plan listed them all here; writing them now would only guess at shapes.
- **`fieldsToSchema(fields, { defaultLocale })`** takes the default language. Required localized fields apply only to that language,
  as the plan states.
- **Widget definitions live in one file** (`application/content/widgets/registry.ts`) instead of one file per type. They are typed
  the same way. Client extensions are merged in the UI layer (Stage 7), so `application` never imports `@client`.
- **Settings field descriptors per group are deferred to Stage 17**, when the settings forms are built. The zod schemas with defaults
  exist now and are what validates stored values.
- **Legal texts are templates.** Placeholders are filled by `fillPlaceholders`. They must be reviewed by the client's lawyer before go-live.
- **Job payload schemas (zod) are deferred to Stage 5**, with the job dispatcher that uses them.
- **Verified:** `npm run check` and `npm run build` exit 0; ESLint reports no layer-boundary violations.

## 2026-10-21 — Stage 5

- **Container instead of `createApp`.** `composition/create-container.ts` returns one object with settings, the job queue,
  the dispatcher, the scheduler, platform adapters and a health check. Routes read it from `Astro.locals.app`.
- **Custom entrypoint calls the container.** `src/worker.ts` forwards queue batches to `jobs.consumeBatch` and cron ticks to
  `scheduler.onTick`. Verified locally: a valid job is acknowledged (`job.done`), an invalid job lands in `failed_jobs`, and a
  cron tick enqueues the periodic jobs.
- **Not yet exercised:** the `RetryableError` retry path and the dead-letter batch. The code is written; a test needs a handler
  that fails on purpose, and no such route exists outside development.
- **Only two repositories exist:** settings and failed jobs. Products, orders, invoices and the rest come with their stages (7, 10,
  11, 14 to 17). The plan lists them under this stage; writing them now would guess at queries the later stages define.
- **`JOBS_MODE=inline` is not implemented.** Local development uses the real queue through `astro dev`, which the adapter
  supports, so an inline fallback is not needed.
- **`defineEndpoint` supports public GET and POST only.** Admin auth, rate limits and bot checks arrive in Stages 13 and 23.
  Responses are `{ ok: true, data }`, so `/api/health` returns `{ ok, data: { ok, d1 } }`.
- **Pdf renderer is typed but unverified.** `BrowserRunPdfRenderer` uses `format: 'a4'` (lowercase, required by the generated types).
  It runs for real in Stage 11.
- **Known gap:** `D1FailedJobRepository.record` reads the time with `new Date()` instead of the Clock port. Fix in Stage 16 with the
  failed-jobs admin page.

## 2026-10-21 — Stage 6

- **Verified:** `npm run check` and `npm run build` exit 0. The UI kit page (since removed) rendered every primitive, the chart SVGs,
  the drawer, the toast region, the hreflang links and the theme variables.
- **Not yet verified:** the 360 px layout (no horizontal scroll) and the carousel/drawer behaviour in a browser. Check on a phone or
  with Chrome DevTools device mode before Stage 7 is signed off.
- **Components are split by file, with two merges:** `Field` wraps any control, and `Input` renders input, select or textarea. The
  empty state, skeleton, badge and rating are separate files. The plan listed separate Checkbox, Select and Textarea files; the
  merged `Input` keeps the same attributes.
- **No Admin layout yet.** `AdminLayout` and `AuthLayout` belong to Stage 13, as the plan says.
- **Toaster is the only island in this stage** (`client:idle`). Charts are server-rendered SVG with a text list for screen readers.
- **Fonts:** all three @fontsource stylesheets are imported. The browser downloads a font file only when text uses it, so the
  unused presets cost nothing on the wire.
- **Cart badge** (`data-cart-count`) exists in the header but has no data until Stage 8 fills it from the cart store.
